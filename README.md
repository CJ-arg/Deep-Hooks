Specific topics of the section What will we see in this section?

Go deeper into the topic of Hooks

Create other customHooks

useState

useCounter - Custom

useEffect and its precautions

useRef

useFetch - Custom + optimizations

useLayoutEffect

memo

useMemo

useCallback

These are relatively simple Hooks, there are still more that we will explain later, but in this section we will focus on these jobs and what they can be used for.

Additionally we will be laying the foundations for what will be an extremely interesting testing section later.
